#Introduction

The goal of this style guide is to present a set of best practices and style guidelines for one AngularJS application.
These best practices are collected from:

0. AngularJS source code
0. Source code or articles I've read
0. My own experience

**Note**: this is still a draft of the style guide, its main goal is to be community-driven so filling the gaps will be greatly appreciated by the whole community.

In this style guide you won't find common guidelines for JavaScript development. Such can be found at:

0. [Google's JavaScript style guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml)
0. [Mozilla's JavaScript style guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/Coding_Style)
0. [GitHub's JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/styleguide/javascript)
0. [Douglas Crockford's JavaScript style guide](http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html)

For AngularJS development recommended is the [Google's JavaScript style guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml).

#General

## Directory structure

Since a large AngularJS application has many components it's best to structure them in a directory hierarchy.
There are two main approaches:

* Creating high level division by component types and lower level division by functionality.

In this way the directory structure will look like:

    * app
        * controllers
            * page1
                * FirstCtrl.js
                * SecondCtrl.js
            * page2
                * ThirdCtrl.js
            * //...
        * directives
            * page1
                * directive1.js
            * page2
                * directive2.js
                * directive3.js
            * commonDirective.js
        * filters
            * page1
                * filter1.js
            commonFilter1.js
            commonFilter2.js
        * services
            * cache
                * Cache1.js
                * Cache2.js
            * models
                * Model1.js
                * Model2.js
            CommonService.js
        app.js
    * test
    * lib

* Creating high level division by functionality and lower level division by component types.

Here is its layout:

    * app
        * page1
            * controllers
                * FirstCtrl.js
                * SecondCtrl.js
            * directives
                * directive1.js
                * directive2.js
            * filters
                * filter1.js
                * filter2.js
            * services
                * service1.js
                * service2.js
            * //...
        * page2
            * controllers
                * ThirdCtrl.js
            * directives
                * directive3.js
                * directive4.js
            * filters
                * filter3.js
            * services
                * service3.js
            //...
        * common
            * controllers
            * directives
            * filters
            * services
        app.js
    * test
    * lib


* The `app.js` file contains routes definition, configuration and/or manual bootstrap (if required).
* In each JavaScript file should be located a single component. The file should be named with the component's name.

I prefer the first structure because it makes the common components easier to find.

Conventions about components naming can be found in each component section.

## Optimize the digest cycle

* Watch only the most vital variables (for example when using real time communication don't cause digest loop in each received message).
* Make computations in `$watch`  as simplest as possible. Making heavy and slow computations in a single `$watch` will slow down the whole application (the $digest loop is done in a single thread because of the single-threaded nature of JavaScript).

## Source Code Layout

* You should keep the components from requiring too many dependencies. But if they do, keep the lines declaring the dependencies no longer than 80 characters.

## Others

* Use:
    * `$timeout`, instead of `setTimeout`
    * `$window`, instead of `window`
    * `$document`, instead of `document`
    * `$http`, instead of `$.ajax`

It will make your testing easier and in some cases prevent you from unexpected behaviour (for example if you missed `$scope.$apply` in `setTimeout`).

* Automate your workflow using tools like:
    * [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io)
    * [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com)
    * [Bower](http://bower.io)

* Use promises (`$q`) instead of callbacks. It will make your code look more elegant, clean and save you from the callback hell.

* Use `$resource` instead of `$http` when possible. Highther level of abstraction saves you from redundancy.

#Modules

There are two commonly used ways for structuring the modules:

0. By functionality
0. By component type

Currently there is not a big difference but the first way looks cleaner. Also if lazy-loading of the modules is being implemented (currently there are no such plans in the roadmap) it will improve the application performance.

#Controllers

* Do not make any DOM manipulations in your controllers. Use directives instead.
* The naming of the controller is done using the controller's functionality (for example shopping card, home page, admin panel) and the substring `Ctrl` in the end. The controllers are named UpperCamelCase (`HomePageCtrl`, `ShippingCardCtrl`, `AdminPanelCtrl`, etc.).
* The controllers should not be defined as globals (no matter AngularJS allows this, it is a bad practice to pollute the global namespace).
* Do not write dependency injection array annotations manually. Keep your code ceremony-free by using [ng-annotate](https://github.com/olov/ng-annotate) or [ngmin](https://github.com/btford/ngmin) in your build-step.
* Make the controllers as skinny as possible
* Communicate within different controllers using method invocation (possible when children wants to communicate with parent) or `$emit`, `$broadcast` and `$on` methods. The `$emit`-ed and `$broadcast`-ed messages must be reduced as much as possible.
* Make a list of all messages which are passed using `$emit`, `$broadcast` and manage it carefully because of name collisions and possible bugs.
* When you need to format data encapsulate the formatting logic into [filter](#filters) and declare it as dependency:


        module.controller('myFormat', function () {
          return function () {
            //body...
          };
        });

        module.controller('MyCtrl', ['$scope', 'myFormatFilter', function ($scope, myFormatFilter) {
          //body...
        }]);


#Directives

* Name your directives with lowerCamelCase
* Use `scope` instead of `$scope` in your link function. In the compile, post/pre link functions you have already defined arguments which will be passed when the function is invoked, you won't be able to change them using DI. This style is also used in AngularJS's source code.
* Use custom prefixes for your directives to prevent name collisions with third-party libraries.
* Do not use `ng` prefix, nor `ui` prefix they are reserved for AngularJS and AngularJS UI usage.
* DOM manipulations must be made only through directives.
* Create isolated scope when you develop reusable components.

#Filters

* Name your filters with lowerCamelCase
* Make your filters as light as possible. They are called often during the `$digest` loop so creating slow filter will slow down your app.

#Services

* Use camelCase (lower or upper) for naming your services.
* Encapsulate the business logic in services.
* For creating services encapsulating the business logic is preferred to use `service` instead of `factory`.
* For session-level cache you can use `$cacheFactory`. It is appropriate for caching results from requests or heavy computations.

#Templates

* Use `ng-bind` or `ng-cloak` instead of simple `{{}}` to prevent flashing content.

#Routing

* Use `resolve` to resolve dependencies before the view is shown.
